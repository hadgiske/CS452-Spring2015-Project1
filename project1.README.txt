/* Game Rules:
/*    - You control the black square
/*	  - Move using arrows keys
/*	  - Try and get the colored squares (fruits)
/*	  - Each color is worth a different amount of points
/*	  - Avoid the falling grey squares (rain) or else game over!
/*
/* Notes: 
/*	  - Model view matrix indicates when player is attempting to move out of bounds.
/*	  - Game reset doesn't work very well, refresh to start a new game for best results.
